							Direct primary care is a type of primary care
							billing and payment arrangement that is made
							directly between patients and medical providers,
							without involving insurance providers. This model
							provides patients with a more personalized and
							direct relationship with their healthcare provider,
							as well as greater convenience and affordability.
							Direct primary care is growing in popularity as a
							care delivery model. When direct primary care
							doctors need specialist opinions on medical cases,
							they may face several challenges. Direct primary
							care doctors may have difficulty accessing
							specialists for consultations. due to the fact that
							they are not part of an existing institutional
							network where specialists can easily be identified
							and sought out. Even when specialists are
							identified, average wait time for patients can be up
							to several months before they can be seen by the
							specialists. In health care, having the right
							information at the right time is of vital importance
							in order to deliver the best care possible.
							Docktorly&#39;s mission is to support direct primary
							care by creating a channel where not only primary
							care providers can connect with specialists easily
							but also receive specialty advice in a timely manner
							in order to solve their patients&#39; medical
							problems with the best information at their
							fingertips. Referring patients to specialists can
							sometimes be a complex and time-consuming process
							for direct primary care doctors. They may need to
							navigate insurance requirements, obtain prior
							authorizations, or coordinate with the patient’s
							insurance company. Docktorly gives primary care
							providers the option to bypass this convoluted
							system that takes time away from patient care. ###
							Access specialists’ opinions without any waiting
							time for referrals. Docktorly is a revolutionary
							platform that connects primary care providers
							with specialist doctors, streamlining the process of
							consultation and enhancing patient care. By
							leveraging our app, primary care providers gain
							access to a network of highly skilled specialists,
							enabling them to provide comprehensive and timely
							care to their patients. With the increasing
							complexity of medical cases and the shortage of
							specialist doctors in certain areas, our platform
							addresses a critical need in the healthcare
							industry. Through our user-friendly interface and
							secure communication channels, we enable primary
							care providers in private practices to seek expert
							advice, request “consultations, and collaborate
							seamlessly with specialists, all within a
							centralized platform.” Our unique value proposition
							lies in the ability to bridge the gap between
							primary care providers and specialist, improving
							patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs by
							achieving the &#147;quadruple aim&#148; as outlined
							by the center of Medicare & Medicaid services (CMS).
							By facilitating efficient and timely consultations,
							we empower primary care providers to make informed
							decisions, avoid unnecessary referrals, and ensure
							the right level of care for their patients. Key
							features of our platform include a market place for
							specialist who want to monetize their expertise
							through consultation. Specialists, like primary care
							providers, are under ever increasing pressure to see
							more patients with less time, all in an effort to
							improve the bottom line for the institutions they
							work for. They, too, are suffering from increased
							rate of burn out with many either retiring early or
							cut back on their work hours. Docktorly provides a
							pathway for specialists to supplement their income
							in a low stress environment where they get to enjoy
							a flexible work schedule, working as much or as
							little as they want. We prioritize data security and
							compliance with industry regulations, ensuring that
							all patient information is protected and
							confidential. Our revenue model is based on a
							marketplace system that charge specialist 5% of
							their consultation fee. Additionally, we have plans
							to explore strategic partnerships with clinics, and
							medical associations to enhance our offerings and
							drive revenue. We project strong growth potential,
							with the market for telemedicine and remote
							consultations expected to expand significantly in
							the coming years. We expect financial projections
							indicate steady revenue growth, supported by a
							well-defined marketing and sales strategy, efficient
							operations, and continuous product development. In
							summary, our platform is positioned to transform the
							collaboration between primary care providers and
							specialist doctors, offering a dynamic marketplace
							for specialists seeking opportunities to showcase
							and offer their unique expertise, providing a
							scalable solution that improves patient care and
							enhances healthcare efficiency. With a strong value
							proposition, a growing market, we are confident in
							our ability to disrupt the healthcare industry and
							deliver significant value to our users.
